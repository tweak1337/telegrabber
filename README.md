Python 3.10

File tlgrabb.py - is a main code to grab posts from any public channels in telegrab and commit in to your Database
File iter_history - is for collect historical messages (for example, 1000 last messages of channel) from any publick channels and commit it to your DB.

I use POSTGRESQL data base, you can use any, even sqlite.
